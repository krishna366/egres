//! Synchronization primitives. All built on the runtime's `park`/
//! `wake` mechanism; no kernel locking, no `std.Thread.Mutex`.
//!
//! Cross-thread correctness: each primitive owns its own
//! `Spinlock` covering the {state, waiters/waiter} composite —
//! short critical sections (a few pointer writes), no syscalls,
//! never held across a `park`. The spinlock + the fiber's
//! `awaken-bit` state machine together close the classic lost-
//! wakeup race: a wake firing between the slow-path "decide to
//! park" and the actual `coro.yield` lands as `awaken=true` on
//! the fiber's `state`, and `park`'s CAS aborts before yielding.
//!
//! Mutex policy: **hand-off**. When `unlock` finds a waiter it
//! transfers ownership directly rather than releasing the lock
//! byte to 0. The woken waiter holds the lock the moment its
//! `park` returns — and VERIFIES it: `unlock` records the grant in
//! `granted_to` before the wake, and the waiter panics if it
//! resumes without its own grant (park-once discipline; a wake
//! must have a reason). FIFO fairness comes free.
