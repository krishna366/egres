//! SemaphoreMap: keyed reader/writer locks with owner tokens and
//! block-time deadlock detection.
//!
//! `acquireMany(keys, owner, mode)` blocks — FIFO, writer-preferred, all
//! delegated to a per-entry `sync.RWMutex` — while conflicting owners
//! hold `key`; it is a no-op for an owner re-acquiring at the same or
//! weaker mode, and returns `error.Deadlock` when granting would close
//! a wait cycle. `owner_id` is an opaque caller token (a transaction
//! id), not fiber identity, so a logical owner can span fibers and any
//! of them may release.
//!
//! There are NO timeouts. Every wait-for cycle has a last edge, and the
//! requester inserting it runs a DFS over the graph under `mu` BEFORE
//! parking — so deadlocks are refused at the door (victim = the
//! edge-closer), no cycle can ever form among parked fibers, and no
//! parked fiber ever needs interrupting.
//!
//! This file never touches fibers, parks, or deadlines: blocking is the
//! entry RWMutex's job. `mu` guards the entry table and the wait-for
//! graph (holders + registration-ordered waiters + `waiting`), which
//! mirror the RWMutex state for detection but never replace it.
//!
//! Keys are bare u64s — typically a hash of the caller's logical key so the map
//! never touches key bytes and the hot path allocates nothing once the entry
//! pool is warm. For hashing callers, a 64-bit collision silently MERGES two
//! keys' locks (false contention, or a false re-entrant no-op for one owner) —
//! never corruption — and with a handful of live entries the odds are ~2^-64;
//! we accept that.

    /// preference is what CREATES the reader-behind-writer deadlocks
    /// these waiter edges catch (drop them and such cycles hang, with no
    /// timeout backstop), and the "ahead of mario" cut is what stops two
    /// writers queued on one key from looking like a cycle. If
    /// sync.RWMutex's discipline ever changes, the "FIFO hand-off" and
    /// "writer preference holds" tests fail here rather than hanging in
