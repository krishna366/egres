//! Holder tracking for the *tracked* `Mutex`/`RWMutex` modes in sync.zig.
//! A triage tool for a wedged server: `dumpLocks` answers "which locks are
//! held, by what code, and for how long?" without a debugger.
//!
//! Why this is tiny compared to the old `u/tracked_mutex.zig`:
//!   - **Waiters are not tracked.** A fiber blocked on a lock is parked in the
//!     lock's own wait queue, so `dumpFibers` already prints its full stack —
//!     strictly more than the old per-lock `last_waiter` `@src`. Gone.
//!   - **Holder/waiter counts are derived, not stored.** They live in the
//!     lock's own fields (`state`/`waiters`; `readers`/`writer`/queues), read
//!     racily at dump time via a per-type `snapshot` fn. Racy is fine — the
//!     system is wedged when we look.
//!   - **No "record release".** "Held" is derived from the lock's state, so a
//!     released lock simply reads `held == 0` and the dump skips it; there's no
//!     counter to decrement and no breadcrumb to clear. `unlock` stays
//!     untouched. Tracking is acquire-only.
//!
//! So a tracked lock embeds only `Tracking`: the holder's acquire `@src`, the
//! acquire timestamp, and the intrusive registry link (+ a once-flag and the
//! type-erasure plumbing to read the lock's live state back at dump time).
